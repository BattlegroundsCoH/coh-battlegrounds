During the occupation of Europe, with Germany nestled in the safety of its neighbouring countries, production and industry had flourished, safe from the bombardments of the Soviets to the East, and the Commonwealth to the West. However, as Operation Market Garden pushed the Allies further into Europe, factories, facilities and power plants alike fell victim; a new emphasis on defence was required, not just to save the Fatherland from destruction, but to keep its industry alive long enough to be of use. Make use of forward positions in this map of attrition, wherein certain territory points will allow you to spawn closer to the action - beware however, as neglecting these points will allow your opponent to use it against you.",

More than three years later, when the Soviets had beaten the Wehrmacht out of Smolensk again, a letter was found in the ruins of a barn in the outskirts of the city. Standing in a muddy puddle next to the road, Major Ivan Danko started to read: >They came to every village/ Picked up us near and far/ To stop the madman Hitler/ The chosen ones we are/ We do not stand a chance/ Oh death is in the air/ Out here we die like flies/ But Stalin doesn't care.< Danko hesitated for a second, then he dropped the dirty sheet of paper and it blew away with the wind.",

Defences around Tula were erected in frozen dirt, turning villages and farms into minefields and killzones. The outskirts of Tula changed hands continuously from October into January, claiming hundreds of vehicles and thousands of lives.",
