The biggest feature of the mod is unit persistency. If a unit gains veterancy or picks up dropped weapons, they'll keep that level of veterancy or obtained item for the next match. If the unit is killed - they're lost forever. Adding an extra layer of strategy to the match. Is calling in a specific unit worth the risk?\n\nThe list of features includes:\n[list]\n[*] Unit persistency\n[*] Enhanced unit design\n[*] Towing of Heavy Team Weapons\n[*] New gamemodes\n[*] New balance dynamics\n[*] New Soviet faction design\n[*] New Wehrmacht faction design\n[*] And more...\n[/list]\n\n[code]DISCLAIMER: [b]ONLY[/b] the Soviet and the Wehrmacht factions are curently playable.[/code]\n\n[h1]Important Links[/h1]\n[list]\n[*] [url=https://discord.com/invite/Hr7yTbSv25]Discord[/url]\n[*] [url=https://cohbattlegrounds.com/]Website[/url]\n[*] [url=https://github.com/JustCodiex/coh2-battlegrounds#readme]Github[/url]\n[/list]\n\n[h1]Final Note[/h1]\nFor more information join our [url=https://discord.com/invite/Hr7yTbSv25]Discord[/url] or read about our mod [url=https://github.com/JustCodiex/coh2-battlegrounds#readme]here.[/url] \nWe hope you will have as much fun as we had making it. \n\nSee you on the battlegrounds,\n[i]Battlegrounds Development Team[/i]"
