The biggest feature of the mod is unit persistency. If a unit gains veterancy or picks up dropped weapons, they'll keep that level of veterancy or obtained item for the next match. If the unit is killed - they're lost forever. Adding an extra layer of strategy to the match. Is calling in a specific unit worth the risk?\r\n\r\nThe list of features includes:\r\n[list]\r\n[*] Unit persistency\r\n[*] Enhanced unit design\r\n[*] Towing of Heavy Team Weapons\r\n[*] New gamemodes\r\n[*] New balance dynamics\r\n[*] New Soviet faction design\r\n[*] New Wehrmacht faction design\r\n[*] And more...\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[code]DISCLAIMER: [b]ONLY[/b] the Soviet and the Wehrmacht factions are curently playable.[/code]\r\n\r\n[h1]Important Links[/h1]\r\n[list]\r\n[*] [url=https://discord.com/invite/Hr7yTbSv25]Discord[/url]\r\n[*] [url=https://cohbattlegrounds.com/]Website[/url]\r\n[*] [url=https://github.com/JustCodiex/coh2-battlegrounds#readme]Github[/url]\r\n[/list]\r\n\r\n[h1]Final Note[/h1]\r\nFor more information join our [url=https://discord.com/invite/Hr7yTbSv25]Discord[/url] or read about our mod [url=https://github.com/JustCodiex/coh2-battlegrounds#readme]here.[/url] \r\nWe hope you will have as much fun as we had making it. \r\n\r\nSee you on the battlegrounds,\r\n[i]Battlegrounds Development Team[/i]"
