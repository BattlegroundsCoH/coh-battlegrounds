# Company of Heroes 2: Battlegrounds*
Welcome to the official git repository for the Company of Heroes 2: Battlegrounds mod. This is a fan-made mod for Company of Heroes 2 where you can design and play with custom-designed player companies that will persist throughout the life of the company.

## Features
The mod offers several new features to the game - as it completely overhauls the way an ingame match is played. The biggest feature of the mod is unit persistency. If a unit gains veterancy, they'll keep that level of veterancy for the next match. If the unit is killed - they're lost forever. The full list of features include:

* Unit persistency
* Enhanced unit design
* Towing of heavy team weapons
* New gamemodes
* New balance dynamics
* New Soviet faction design
* New Wehrmacht faction design
* And more...

## Development
This mod is still in development but is slowly progressing towards a playable alpha. You can see the progress under the projects tab.
