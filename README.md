# Company of Heroes 2: Battlegrounds*

Welcome to the official git repository for the Company of Heroes 2: Battlegrounds mod. This is a fan-made mod for Company of Heroes 2 where you can design and play with custom-designed player companies that will persist throughout the life of the company. This repository contains the source code for the main application. The networking code in use is not public, but the usage can be viewed within the source code of this repository.

The repository also contains the SCAR code of the wincondition that is dynamically compiled by the launcher - as each match require a unique win condition.

## Features

The mod offers several new features to the game - as it completely overhauls the way an ingame match is played. The biggest feature of the mod is unit persistency. If a unit gains veterancy or pick up dropped weapons, they'll keep that level of veterancy or obtained item for the next match. If the unit is killed - they're lost forever. Adding an extra layer of strategy to the match. Is calling in a specific unit worth the risk?

The full list of features include:

* Unit persistency
* Enhanced unit design
* Towing of heavy team weapons
* New gamemodes
* New balance dynamics
* New Soviet faction design
* New Wehrmacht faction design
* And more...

## Development

This mod is still in development but is slowly progressing towards a playable alpha. You can see the progress under the projects tab.

At the moment a Battlegrounds match is playable through the launcher and can be played against AI as well as other people.
