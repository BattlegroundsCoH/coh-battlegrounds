Welcome to Composite Design hell :P

This is an extreme case of the 3-1-2 process, where all variability points possible have been identified and turned into interfaces and tasks delegated.
However, this should now allow for a highly modular and well-controlled playing session protocol.

A battlegrounds match consists of four elements:
1. Startup:
	- Here all relevant match data is collected and compiled into the .sga archive. This may vary depending on who and what kind of gamemode is being played.
2. Playing:
	- Here the players play the match. This can be controlled (Though the OverwatchStrategy : IPlayStrategy) will handle most behaviour here.
	- It's technically possible to simulate a match here.
3. Analysis:
	- Here the match data retrieved from the previous phase is analyzed and it's decided what changes to make to participating companies. (Other stuff may also be retrieved from this).
4. Finalize:
	- Here the analysis modification suggestions are finalized (if applicable) and changes to participating companies are finalized.

To start a match, it's much easier to let the MatchController handle the actual protocol. However, you can set custom strategies defining how the 4 elements mentioned above are to be executed.
